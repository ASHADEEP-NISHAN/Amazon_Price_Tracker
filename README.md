Title: Amazon Price Tracker Using Web Scraping in Python

Description:

The "Amazon Price Tracker Using Web Scraping in Python" is a Python program designed to track the price of a specific product on Amazon and notify the user when the price drops below a predefined target.

Features:

1-Web Scraping: The program utilizes web scraping techniques to extract the current price of the specified product from its Amazon product page. It employs the requests library to fetch the HTML content of the page and BeautifulSoup for parsing the HTML and extracting relevant information, such as the product price.

2-Price Tracking: The main functionality of the program is to continuously monitor the price of the product. It compares the current price with a target price set by the user. If the current price falls below the target price, the program notifies the user.

3-Customization: The user can specify the URL of the Amazon product page they want to track and set a target price for the product. The program then checks the price periodically and alerts the user when the price drops below the target.

4-Scalability: The program can be easily extended to track multiple products simultaneously by modifying the main function to accept a list of product URLs and corresponding target prices.

5-Robustness: The program includes error handling mechanisms to handle cases such as invalid URLs or missing price information on the product page. Additionally, it incorporates a delay between successive price checks to avoid overloading Amazon's servers and mitigate the risk of being blocked.

6-Legal and Ethical Considerations:

7-Respect for Terms of Service: Users are reminded to comply with Amazon's terms of service and avoid excessive scraping that could disrupt the normal operation of the website or violate its policies.

8-Responsibility: Users should use the program responsibly and ensure that their scraping activities are legal and ethical. Scraping should not infringe upon the rights of the website owner or violate any applicable laws or regulations.

9-Data Privacy: Users should be aware of data privacy considerations when using web scraping tools and avoid collecting personal or sensitive information without proper authorization.

10-Usage:
The program can be run from the command line or integrated into larger applications. Users can customize the product URL and target price according to their preferences. Upon execution, the program continuously monitors the price of the specified product and alerts the user when the price drops below the target.
